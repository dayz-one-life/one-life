## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- Solo maintainer mode: back-merge PRs (`main`→`develop`) are no longer blocked by the contribution CHANGELOG/CLAUDE.md gate. The solo `gh-pr-create` check now parses `--head` and exempts `head == productionBranch`, mirroring the merge handler.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- `soloMaintainer` mode: an opt-in `.claude/workflow.json` flag that enables a `solo` guard role holding the union of contributor + maintainer permissions, so one person can run the full workflow (feature work, contribution merge, release, back-merge) from a single clone without swapping git remotes. Protected branches stay PR-only and contribution merges into `develop` still require `--squash` + a posted review (a `COMMENTED` review counts). Off by default.
