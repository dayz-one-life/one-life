# CLAUDE.md

This project was created from the Claude Code workflow template. The workflow below is
enforced by committed hooks in `.claude/` and streamlined by repo-level skills.

## On session start

A SessionStart hook injects a role-aware orientation. **Present that orientation to the
user at the start of a fresh session.**

## The workflow

1. All feature work happens on a **fork**, on a `feature/*` branch.
2. Updating this file (`CLAUDE.md`) is the **last step** before opening a PR.
3. `CHANGELOG.md` is updated on **every** PR.
4. PRs go into the canonical repo's **`develop`** branch.
5. Reviews are done in Claude Code and posted back to the contributor.
6. Approved PRs are **squash-merged** into `develop`.
7. Production releases go out via a **`develop` → `main`** PR.
8. Merging that PR **cuts a release** with notes.

## Skills

- Contributor: `starting-work`, `finishing-a-feature`.
- Maintainer: `reviewing-a-contribution`, `merging-a-contribution`, `drafting-a-release`, `cutting-a-release`.
- Setup: `workflow-setup` (run once).

## Guardrails (enforced by `.claude/hooks/guard.py`)

- No commits, pushes, or merges on `main`/`develop` (tag pushes and the one-time `workflow.json` setup commit are exempt).
- On a fork: PRs must target `develop` and require CHANGELOG.md + CLAUDE.md updates.
- On the canonical repo: feature work is blocked (fork instead). Fork contributions into `develop` must be squash-merged and approved; the maintainer's own same-repo release/back-merge PRs are exempt from that gate.
- Once the project is initialized (`workflow-setup` run), write/git actions are blocked unless the Superpowers plugin is installed.
- **Solo maintainer mode:** setting `soloMaintainer: true` in `.claude/workflow.json` activates a `solo` role that holds the union of contributor + maintainer permissions from a single clone (no remote swapping). Protected branches stay PR-only; contribution merges into `develop` still require `--squash` + a posted review (a `COMMENTED` review counts, since self-approval is impossible); release (`develop`→`main`) and back-merge (`main`→`develop`) PRs are exempt from the changelog/review gates. Off by default.

## Honest limitations

- Hooks only bind inside Claude Code; plain `git`/`gh` in a shell bypasses them.
- Superpowers/role detection are filesystem/remote heuristics; they fail with clear messages.
- Approved-review detection needs the canonical repo to be a real GitHub remote.

## Configuration

`.claude/workflow.json` holds `canonicalRepo`, branch names, the optional `soloMaintainer` flag (default `false`), and optional `commands.test`/`commands.lint`.

# One Life MVP

DayZ community platform: tracks each player's single life (birth→death across sessions),
24h-bans them when a qualified life dies, and lets them earn back in via emote verification +
an unban-token economy. Single-tenant, multi-server (Xbox). Ported lean from the archived
`../one-life-platform` (news/LLM stack dropped). MVP scope + decomposition:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-one-life-mvp-definition-design.md`.

## Sub-projects

- **SP1 — Foundation + ADM ingest + lives** ✅ (this branch): multi-server Nitrado ADM-log
  ingest → event log → life/player/session/kill projections + qualified-lives read model.
- **SP2** — auth (Better Auth: Discord/Google/GitHub/magic-link) + web + emote verification (next).
- **SP3** — 24h death-ban enforcement (Nitrado ban list). **SP4** — unban-token economy.
- **SP5** — RPT ingest + character mapping (survivor model per life). Device-based alt detection
  is **cut** — DayZ removed the `[MAM]` device-hash log lines in 1.29; alts fall back to Nitrado's
  built-in Multi-Account Mitigation.

## Monorepo (pnpm + turbo, TS/ESM, Postgres + Drizzle)

- **packages:** `db` (12-table core schema + migrations), `domain` (zod events, emote/weapon
  dicts), `nitrado` (log-file client), `adm-parser` (pure ADM line parser), `event-log`
  (append/cursor over `events`), `projections` (fold logic), `read-models` (stats queries),
  `test-support` (Postgres test harness).
- **apps:** `ingest-worker` (ADM poll→events loop), `projector` (events→projections fold).

## Commands

- Test: `pnpm turbo run test --concurrency=1` (DB suites need `TEST_DATABASE_URL`).
  Typecheck: `pnpm turbo run typecheck`.
- Local Postgres: `docker compose up -d postgres`. **Note:** a gitignored
  `docker-compose.override.yml` may remap the host port (this dev machine uses 5434, not 5432).
